     <p>There have been 55 race winners in the 67 editions of the Macau Grand Prix, an annual automobile road event for single seater racing cars that has been held every third or fourth weekend of November on the Guia Circuit in the streets of the territory of Macau. It was founded in 1954 by Fernando Macedo Pinto, Carlos da Silva and Paulo Antas as a local treasure hunt for car enthusiasts in the Pearl River Delta territory, but Swiss expatriate Paul Dutoit suggested that the route be used for local professional motor races. John MacDonald holds the record for the most Macau Grand Prix victories, having won the race four times. There have been eight drivers who have achieved two victories in Macau. Six drivers have won the race twice in succession but none have claimed three or more consecutive victories. The first winner of the Macau Grand Prix was the local driver Eduardo de Carvalho at the 1954 sports car event, and the most recent competitor to achieve their first victory in the territory was Hon Chio Leong of Macau who took his first win in the 2020 Formula 4 race.</p>
